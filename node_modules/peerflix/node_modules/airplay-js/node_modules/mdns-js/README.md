mDNS-js
==========

Pure JavaScript/NodeJS mDNS discovery implementation.

A lot of the functionality is copied from 
https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples/tree/master/mdns-browser
but adapted for node.

Install by

    npm install mdns-js


Future
------
It would be great to have a full implementation of mDSN + DNS-SD in pure JS but
progress will be slow unless someone is willing to pitch in with
pull requests, specifications for wanted functions etc.
Also, as you should avoid to have multiple mDNS stacks on a system this
might clash with stuff like avahi and bonjour.


example
-------

```javascript
var mdns = require('mdns-js');

var browser = new mdns.createBrowser();

browser.on('ready', function () {
    browser.discover(); 
});

browser.on('update', function (data) {
    console.log('data:', data);
});
```



Debugging
---------
This library is using the [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) 
module from TJ Holowaychuk and can be used like this.

```bash
DEBUG=mdns* node examples/simple.js
```

This will spit out a lot of information that might be useful.


Contributing
------------
Pull-request will be gladly accepted.

If possible any api should be as close match to the api of node-mdns but
be pragmatic. Look at issue #5.

Before creating a pull-request please run 

    npm run lint 

on any changed code.
There is a .jshintrc file included in the project, use it, and don't 
be offended by it.
