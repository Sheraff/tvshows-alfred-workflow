    "overview": "Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by Titans. Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest Titans. Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a Titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a Colossal Titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller Titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single Titan and take revenge for all of mankind.",

The recruits are later greeted by Erwin who tells them the Recon Corps' next expedition within a month is to reclaim Shiganshina and find the secret hidden in Eren's home basement. After telling the recruits of the Recon Corps' fatalities in each expedition, Erwin tells the recruits that they may stay and join them or leave to join the other branches. As many recruits leave, Jean joins the Recon Corps in honor of Marco with others joining him as well including Mikasa, Armin, Sasha, Connie, Ymir, Krista, Reiner, and Bertolt despite their fears. As the Recon Corps prepares themselves for the expedition, Eren is reunited with his friends and learns what happened to the others.",

After Armin's squad manages to kill an Aberrant Titan, a female-looking Titan suddenly appears from the right flank in full speed. Much to Armin's shock, the Female Titan's body can withstand their blades and is intelligent enough to kill his seniors easily. The Female Titan captures Armin but after removing his hood and seeing his face, she leaves him alive and continues running. Armin is picked up by Reiner and Jean who reveals their right flank was destroyed by the Titans, which makes Armin realize it was the Female Titan's work and is possibly another Titan Shifter like Eren. When the three of them give conflicting sources on where Eren is, they realize the Female Titan's target is Eren and they must stop it.",

After exchanging several blows, a berserk Eren completely overpowers Annie who attempts to escape by climbing up Wall Sina. However, Mikasa cuts off Annie's Titan fingers, sending her falling. As Annie falls, she remembers her father asking for forgiveness, telling her to hate the world and ask her to promise him she will come back home. When it appears Eren is about to eat Annie, he stops once he sees her crying, and her body starts encasing itself in crystal. As Eren recuperates, he admits to Mikasa, Jean, and Armin that he allowed Annie to get herself encased. As Jean and Armin wonder if sacrificing their humanity to defeat the Titans is worth the price, Erwin attends a government inquiry. Erwin reveals he kept his plans secret to prevent leaks. He further explains that despite the deaths and casualties of his plan and how they cannot get any information from Annie now that she is encased, she is proof there are humans that can turn into Titans living within the walls and he plans to find and use them to launch a counterattack against the Titans. In the end, Erwin's name is cleared, Eren stays with the Recon Corps, Annie is put under the Corps' custody and the rest of the 104th Top Trainees go on their different missions. In the epilogue, a piece of Wall Sina falls, revealing the face of a Titan within the wall. ",
