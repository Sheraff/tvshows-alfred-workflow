TV Shows manager (Beta version) [download link](https://github.com/Sheraff/tvshows-alfred-workflow/raw/master/TV%20Show%20Manager.alfredworkflow "TV Shows manager.alfredworkflow")
=======================

Stream your favorite shows right from [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/ "Alfred App official website"). Remember which episode you’re at (and where you stopped in it), know if a new episode is out, download for later...

Everything you want for TV Shows is in this workflow.

## quick use

First and foremost, [download the workflow](https://github.com/Sheraff/tvshows-alfred-workflow/raw/master/TV%20Show%20Manager.alfredworkflow "TV Shows manager.alfredworkflow").

This workflow makes use of [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/), if you don’t know what it is, you probably don’t have it. If you don’t like to tinker with your computer, your journey ends here :-(

It also uses [peerflix](https://github.com/mafintosh/peerflix)(`sudo npm install -g peerflix`), [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)(just a media player to download) and [terminal notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier)(`sudo gem install terminal-notifier`).

So if you have all that in the regular locations, it should work right out of the box.
