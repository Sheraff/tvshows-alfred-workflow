TV Shows manager (Beta version) [download link](https://github.com/Sheraff/piratebay-alfred-workflow/blob/master/Piratebay.alfredworkflow?raw=true "Piratebay.alfredworkflow")
=======================

Stream your favorite shows right from [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/ "Alfred App official website"). Remember which episode you’re at (and where you stopped in it), know if a new episode is out, download for later...

Everything you want for TV Shows is in this workflow.

## summary
This is a workflow for [Alfred App](http://www.alfredapp.com/ "Alfred App official website") (Mac OSX) to crawl [piratebay](http://thepiratebay.se/ "the pirate bay") and return magnet links with proper information.

If you want to see what it looks like, here's a [link to a live demo](http://sheraff.github.io/alfred-workflow-mockup/ "live demo"), or simply stare at this lame gif below:
